## 🔥 Top 5 Critical Issues

### 1. Broken Async Transaction (CRITICAL-1)
**Risk:** Data corruption, race conditions  
**File:** `packages/backend/src/db/database.ts:217-234`  
**Fix Time:** 2 hours  
**Impact:** 🔴 HIGH

The `transactionAsync` method is fundamentally broken and will cause data corruption under concurrent load.

```typescript
// BROKEN CODE
async transactionAsync<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
  this.db.transaction(() => {
    fn().then((res) => { result = res; }); // Transaction completes before promise!
  })();
  return result!; // Returns undefined!
}
```

**Action:** Remove method entirely, refactor all callers to use synchronous transactions.

---

### 2. Path Traversal Race Condition (CRITICAL-2)
**Risk:** Arbitrary file access, server compromise  
**File:** `packages/backend/src/utils/security.ts:8-35`  
**Fix Time:** 4 hours  
**Impact:** 🔴 HIGH

TOCTOU vulnerability allows attackers to bypass path validation via symlink attacks.

**Action:** Implement file descriptor-based validation.

---

### 3. XSS via Unicode (CRITICAL-3)
**Risk:** Cross-site scripting, session hijacking  
**File:** `packages/backend/src/utils/security.ts:68-81`  
**Fix Time:** 1 hour  
**Impact:** 🔴 HIGH

Missing Unicode line terminator escaping allows XSS attacks.

**Action:** Add `\u2028` and `\u2029` escaping.

---

### 4. No CSRF Protection (CRITICAL-7)
**Risk:** Unauthorized actions, account takeover  
**File:** All API routes  
**Fix Time:** 4 hours  
**Impact:** 🔴 HIGH

No CSRF tokens or SameSite cookies allow cross-site request forgery.

**Action:** Implement CSRF middleware.

---

### 5. No Authentication (ARCH-1)
**Risk:** Unauthorized access, data manipulation  
**File:** All API routes  
**Fix Time:** 8 hours  
**Impact:** 🟠 MEDIUM

Anyone can create, modify, or delete apps without authentication.

**Action:** Implement API key authentication.

---

## 📈 Performance Issues

### Database Bottlenecks
- **No connection pooling** - Single SQLite connection limits scalability
- **Missing indexes** - Slow queries on large datasets
- **No caching** - Every request hits database

### Estimated Impact
- Current capacity: ~100 concurrent users
- With fixes: ~1,000+ concurrent users
- Response time improvement: 50-70%

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Gaps

### Missing Production Features
- ❌ Authentication/Authorization
- ❌ Rate limiting per user
- ❌ Structured logging
- ❌ Metrics collection
- ❌ Health checks (liveness/readiness)
- ❌ Graceful shutdown
- ❌ Database migrations
- ❌ API versioning

Day 4: Security testing (OWASP ZAP, penetration test)
Day 5: Deploy to staging, monitor
```

### Week 2: Performance
```bash
Day 1-2: Database pooling and indexes
Day 3: Caching layer
Day 4: Circuit breaker improvements
Day 5: Load testing, optimization
```

Week 4: Health checks, graceful shutdown, migrations
```

---

## 📋 Quick Wins (< 1 hour each)

1. **Add request size limits** (CRITICAL-5)
   ```typescript
   app.use(express.json({ limit: '1mb' }));
   ```

2. **Fix memory leak** (CRITICAL-4)
   ```typescript
   this.checkpointInterval.unref();
   ```

3. **Add compression** (PERF-5)
   ```typescript
   app.use(compression());
   ```

4. **Update XSS escaping** (CRITICAL-3)
   ```typescript
   .replace(/\u2028/g, '&#x2028;')
   .replace(/\u2029/g, '&#x2029;')
   ```
